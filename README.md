Telco Customer Churn Analysis

Project Type: End-to-End Data Analyst Project
Tools Used: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
Dataset: Telco Customer Churn Dataset (CSV)

Project Overview

Customer churn occurs when a customer stops using a company's service, leading to revenue loss. This project predicts churn by analyzing customer behavior and service patterns to help businesses improve retention.

The project covers data exploration, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization, providing a complete end-to-end workflow.
